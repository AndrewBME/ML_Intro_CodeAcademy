# ML Intro -- CodeAcademy


Introduction to Machine Learning from Code Academy. Coded by Andrew Chen, instructed by Code Academy. Open source just for learning. Happy coding!

#### Note 
This just offers the code of a toddler (at least Andrew is still a todeler now). Please make sure to set up your environment, install required packages to start the journey! 

## Bayes' Theorem 
To be short, Bayes' Theorem can be used to describe the probability of a hypothesis of a given hypothesis. It can be the capestone of machine learing.

Formula: P(H|D) = P(D|H)*P(H)/P(D) 

The Bayes' Theorem introduced here is majorly Naive Bayes Classifier. The datasets are independent of another. 

In the project, you will learn how to make a email spam with Naive Bayes Classifer. 

(But I did not store the code, so it is not here sorry about that)

## Decision Tree

## Perceptron 

## Random Forest
